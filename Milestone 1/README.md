### Milestone 1: Web crawling data by using Python  

a) Acquisition of crude oil price data via web scrape using Scrapy and Selenium libraries  

b) News article web scrape from online news website using Selenium and BeautifulSoup libraries

c) News article web scrape from market insider using scrapy and selenium

   Web scraping process will be running from week 3 until week 13.

   Selenium is required because some HTML elements involved JavaScript and can only be executed in the internet browser, and 
   that JavaScript will grab data for a webpage. 

   Make sure chrome driver is downloaded, required by Selenium. Can be downloaded from  
   https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/
   Download chrome driver for version 80 (and above depend on your chrome's version). Put the chromedriver.exe in the 
   directory of the project folder.

d) Video uploaded in Google drive due to space issue
